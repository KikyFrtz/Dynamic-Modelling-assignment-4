    "In this assignment, you will design a domain model based on an existing text, and fully implement it using the L2-Python software. You can use the model template as an example of this process. The basis for the model is formed by the text provided in the next section, about the topic of loneliness. In order to convert this description into a working simulation model, you should take the steps described in this Notebook as well as the template."

    "### Literature about loneliness\n",
    "\n",
    "Loneliness is a universal human emotion, of which the form and intensity vary strongly across individuals and over time. According to recent literature[1], the central element in the development of loneliness is the *feeling of loneliness*. Cacioppo and Patrick (2008) identified three main factors that play a role in determining how lonely people feel. First, your *basic level of vulnerability* to social disconnection determines how strongly you need social connections. This level is genetically determined, hence it is difficult to change. Second, your *emotion regulation ability* has a diminishing effect on your feeling of loneliness. For example, people who are more skilled at applying emotion regulation strategies (like ‘focusing on positive things’) will feel less lonely than people who do not possess these skills. The ability to regulate your emotions can be improved by regular *training*. Third, your *expectations about others* influence the experience of loneliness in the sense that people who constantly interpret their friends’ behaviour as rejecting are more likely to feel lonely. Learning to change your expectations about others can also be achieved using *training*. In addition to these three factors, a (more trivial) fourth factor is the *amount of social activities* people enjoy. Finally, the feeling of loneliness may have a number of negative effects, both behaviourally and a physically level. These effects include, among others, *alcoholism*, and a higher *chance on cardiovascular diseases*.\n",
